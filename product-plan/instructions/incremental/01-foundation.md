# Milestone 1: Foundation

## About These Instructions

**What you're receiving:**
- Finished UI designs (React components with full styling)
- Data model definitions (TypeScript types and sample data)
- UI/UX specifications (user flows, requirements, screenshots)
- Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Test-writing instructions for each section (for TDD approach)

**What you need to build:**
- Project setup and configuration
- Routing structure
- Data fetching and state management
- Integration of the provided UI components with real data

**Important guidelines:**
- **DO NOT** redesign or restyle the provided components — use them as-is
- **DO** wire up the callback props to your routing and API calls
- **DO** replace sample data with real data from your backend
- **DO** implement proper error handling and loading states
- **DO** use test-driven development — write tests first using `tests.md` instructions
- The components are props-based and ready to integrate — focus on the backend and data layer

## Goal

Set up the foundational elements: design tokens, data model types, routing structure, and application shell.

## What to Implement

### 1. Design Tokens

Configure your styling system with these tokens:

- See `product-plan/design-system/tokens.css` for CSS custom properties
- See `product-plan/design-system/tailwind-colors.md` for Tailwind configuration
- See `product-plan/design-system/fonts.md` for Google Fonts setup

### 2. Data Model Types

Create TypeScript interfaces for your core entities:

- See `product-plan/data-model/types.ts` for interface definitions
- See `product-plan/data-model/README.md` for entity relationships

### 3. Routing Structure

Create routes for each section:

- `/` — Home (hero landing page)
- `/story` — Story (career timeline)
- `/work` — Work (portfolio)
- `/kudos` — Kudos (testimonials gallery)
- `/connect` — Connect (contact form)

### 4. Application Shell

Copy the shell components from `product-plan/shell/components/` to your project:

- `AppShell.tsx` — Main layout wrapper
- `MainNav.tsx` — Navigation component with mobile menu
- `index.ts` — Exports

**Wire Up Navigation:**

Connect navigation to your routing:

| Nav Item | Route |
|----------|-------|
| Mike Lacey (brand) | `/` |
| Home | `/` |
| Story | `/story` |
| Work | `/work` |
| Kudos | `/kudos` |
| Connect | `/connect` |

**Note:** This is a public portfolio site with no user authentication or user menu.

## Files to Reference

- `product-plan/design-system/` — Design tokens
- `product-plan/data-model/` — Type definitions
- `product-plan/shell/README.md` — Shell design intent
- `product-plan/shell/components/` — Shell React components

## Done When

- [ ] Design tokens are configured (colors, fonts)
- [ ] Data model types are defined
- [ ] Routes exist for all sections (can be placeholder pages)
- [ ] Shell renders with navigation
- [ ] Navigation links to correct routes
- [ ] Active state shows on current route
- [ ] Mobile menu works on small screens
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
